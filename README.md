RPT-MCP
Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server by Risk Pro Technology

Welcome to the official repository for RPT-MCP, a project developed by Risk Pro Technology to power AI systems with context-aware capabilities.

🚀 Overview
This project is built around the concept of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, which acts as a universal interface between AI models and the external world. It allows AI to connect with tools, resources, and structured prompts through a standardized protocol—unlocking smarter, context-driven automation and decision-making.

🧠 What is an MCP Server?
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server enables AI models to:

Access dynamic tools and APIs

Retrieve and process contextual information in real-time

Work across applications, systems, and data sources

Perform advanced tasks with better situational awareness

In short, the MCP server is a context bridge—empowering AI to do more than just generate responses. It enables AI to act intelligently within specific workflows, environments, and tasks.
